TEXTURE V.0.5 (C)2K2 BY THE TOXIC AVENGER/AINC.

INTRODUCTION
------------

Texture is a simple (delphi-)program to
create TextureMaps, BackgroundGFX and
of course, psychedelic Pictures.. =)

The resulting files can be used with delphi
or fpc by including the texture-unit
("tex.pas") also included in this package..

Different from "professional" DTP-Progs
(like f.e. PhotoShop), Texture does not
need to save the resulting Bitmap-Files,
but it saves the steps which were used
to create the final image..
These steps may be included directly
as Pascal (delphi/fpc) Source..
So it's possible to 'store' a 512x512-RGB
Bitmap in full quality at only about
100 Bytes (!!)..
(not to mention that it would also be
possible to store a 4096x4096-RGB
within those few bytes =)

For all Users who don't want to create
64KB-3D-Intros =) there's also a "normal"
BMP-Export and a TEX-File-Save.

USAGE
-----

Just play around.. =)
It's really easy..

Basics:
-There are 4 Layers and the final image ("Final Layer")..
-On every layer you can experiment with the Renderers and
 different combinations of Color/Filter/Distort-Functions..
-The Randomize Button is always good for experiments..

-Render puts out the "basic" image..
-Color changes Color-Values (in RGB- or HSV-Color-Space)..
-Filter is like the dtp-filters you should already know.. 8-)
-Distort displaces/wobbles the image..
-Layer Combine is used to arrange the final
 image from the 4 Layers..
 ("Distort"=Distort Layer1 through Layer2 (%1=X-Distort, %2=Y-Distort),
  "Add"=Add/Subtract Layers, "Mul"=Multiply Layers,
  "Max"=Maximum Value of Layer1/2, "Min"=Minimum Value of Layer1/2,
  "Random"=Random Pixels combined from Layers,
  "Xor"/"And"/"Or"=Xor/And/Or (Binary Ops) Layers,
  "Nothing"=Do Nothing)


To include the pictures directly in your delphi/fpc
project take a look at "TexITest.pas"..

To load TEX-Files into your delphi/fpc project
during runtime take a look at "TexLTest.pas".
